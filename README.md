## Project Name & Pitch
Wallet APP

An application used to create and manage budget built with React, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS.

## Project Status
This project is currently in development. Users may create and manage their wallets but the data has to be persisted somewhere (which is not the case currently) - therefore I'm planning to hook it up with Firebase in the near future.

## Reflection
This was a 1 week long project built during my front-end web development bootcamp at Re-coded. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features all of which has been achieved by leveraging `react`, `react-router-5.0` and `tailwindcss`.
